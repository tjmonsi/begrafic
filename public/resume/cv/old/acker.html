Your web site is quite impressive. I especially enjoyed         all of the print collateral and identity branding work. I received my         Bachelor of Arts degree from CSULB in Journalism/Public Relations in 1991         and completed coursework at Art Center College of Design in 1997. I have         been working in web and graphic design for the past twelve years, while         keeping abreast of the latest software and design techniques.</font></p>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have extensive         experience designing direct mail pieces, print and web ads, and brochures,         as well as over four years consulting experience in re-branding corporate         identities/logos. <strong>I have developed successful marketing campaigns         and produced numerous web sites.

Also, as a native Spanish         speaker, I translated documents and facilitated bilingual discussions         for geologists conducting research in Mexico.
