  <div class="content"><p>I have extensive experience in everything related to the web: conducting usability testing, developing new information architecture, wireframing, designing, building, and marketing bilingual websites. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from California State University, Long Beach in Journalism, Public Relations, and Spanish in 1991 and completed coursework at Art Center College of Design in 1997.</p>
    <p>Throughout my twenty-year career, I have been involved in the planning and management of hundreds of outstanding design and development projects for companies such as FoxSports.com, Netscape, SFUSD, Disney and many dot-com startups. I am currently leading the digital presence team for Stater Bros. Markets, including selecting a new CMS platform to develop responsive websites and employee kiosks.  In addition to superior research and analytical skills, I am capable of managing multiple projects and delivering quality work while meeting deadlines successfully.</p>
    <p>As the first webmaster and designer at Caltech, I collaborated extensively with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional material, both online and in print. I served as designer and editor of the original Caltech Alumni Newsletter, supervised staff, and taught classes in design and HTML. Also, as a native Spanish speaker, I translated documents and facilitated bilingual discussions for geologists conducting research in Mexico. I translated several storefront sites (MLB/Copeland's/Victory) into Spanish. </p>
    <p>I conducted a web usability study for Intergraph Corporation where I restructured the intergraph.com site's information architecture and created new wireframes with intuitive navigation. I am extremely well-organized, resourceful, proactive, and energetic. I believe my design skills, project management experience, and effective communication skills will be a valuable asset to your group. I look forward to helping SpaceX embrace the user experience by applying intuitive design principles using the latest technology available. Attached are links to design samples and my LinkedIn profile, containing several recommendations. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br />
      Beatrice Aispuro</p>
