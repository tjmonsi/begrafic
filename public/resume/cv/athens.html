I am excited to learn more about potential        collaborations on a contract basis or in a teaching capacity; sharing        what I have learned throughout my career as webmaster, designer, and        entrepreneur.<span class="text2"> I        received my Bachelor of Arts degree from California State University,        Long Beach in Journalism, Public Relations, and Spanish in 1991 and completed        coursework at Art Center College of Design in 1997. </span></p>      <p class="text2">Throughout my fifteen-year career, I have been involved          in the planning and management of hundreds of outstanding design and          outreach projects.Â  I have extensive experience designing print and          web collateral and re-branding corporate identities. <span class="text3">I          have developed successful marketing and outreach        campaigns, and produced numerous web sites. In addition to superior research        and analytical skills, I am capable of managing multiple projects and        delivering quality work while meeting deadlines successfully.</span></p>      <p class="text3"><span class="text3">As the first webmaster and designer          at Caltech, I collaborated extensively with staff and faculty in creating          and developing promotional material, both online and in print. I served          as designer and editor </span>of the original        Caltech Alumni Newsletter, supervised staff and also taught classes in        design. <span class="text4">As a native Spanish speaker, I translated documents and          facilitated bilingual discussions for geologists          conducting research in Mexico. I translated several storefront sites        (MLB/Copeland's/Victory) into Spanish.</span></p>      <p class="text4">I believe my web skills, my project management        experience, and my design sense as it applies to typography, photography,    and creative imagery will be a valuable asset to your group. I have        always enjoyed being a part of collaborative projects, and I feel that        I could contribute a lot of energy and enthusiasm toward the work assigned        me. Below are several links to my designs (some show before &amp; after).        Thanks again for your time. I look forward to meeting up with you after    the holidays. Enjoy!!</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top"><p class="text4">Kind regards,<br />    Beatrice Aispuro </p>    <p><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/resume/vi.html" target="_blank"><img src="../images/besig_wht.gif" width="103" height="180" border="0" /></a></p></td>    <td>      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/clients/lightcraft/index.html" target="_blank">Lightcraft Redesign</a></p>      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/clients/ggh/" target="_blank">Gloria's Logo</a></p>      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/clients/fy" target="_blank">Fountain          of Youth Ads/Branding</a></p>      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.victorysweepers.com" target="_blank">Victory          Sweepers Site</a></p>      <p align="right"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/clients/dolce" target="_blank">Mezcal          Co.
