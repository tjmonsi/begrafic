I checked your site hasleyhomes.com today and        it was incredibly slow on my machine as well. I am on a Mac G5 dual        processor, which is a very fast machine. I uploaded the web site sample        that I recently did for a non-paying client.  <a href="http://www.begrafic.com/be/comp/" target="_blank">Click        on this link</a>. It will probably be the layout for joeDL.com.</p>      <p class="style16">Like I mentioned yesterday, I bill by the hour ($45/hr)        and estimated the cost (pkgs) for your house listing galleries/collages         to run at $500 for basic 1-2 page site, $750 for med. 3-4 page site,        and around $1500 for deluxe site like <a href="http://www.casa121.com/">casa121</a>.        The cost will depend on the time and number/quality of photos.</p>      <p class="style16">These estimates were not intended for your more complex        site. Since        I do not know how involved  hasleyhomes.com will be yet, I can't give        you a more precise figure, but estimate that it could run between $2500-3500.        Of course, all of my work is bright, colorful, intuitively organized,        and sure to engage your viewers. This would set you apart from your competitors        and never need a redesign because it will be built to your satisfaction.</p>      <p class="style16">I looked on the godaddy website for the domain halseyhomes.com,        but unfortunately it is taken. Since many many people might misspell        your name, it would have been a good idea to buy the misspelled        name and mirror it as we discussed. I am having trouble keeping it straight        myself, so I can imagine that it is a problem. It's not too        late to look at other options for future campaigns; at $10/yr per domain,        it's worth securing new ones before they are taken because once they        are gone, they're gone!</p>      <p class="style16">Since you requested a copy of my resume, I will include        some background information on me. I        received my Bachelor of Arts degree from California State University,        Long Beach in Journalism, Public Relations, and Spanish in 1991 and completed        coursework at Art Center College of Design in 1997. </p>      <p class="style10">Throughout            my fifteen-year career, I have been involved in the planning and            management of hundreds of outstanding design and outreach projects.&nbsp; I          have extensive experience designing print and web collateral and re-branding            corporate identities. I have developed successful marketing and outreach            campaigns, and produced numerous web sites. In addition to superior            research and analytical skills, I            am capable of managing multiple projects and delivering quality work            while meeting deadlines successfully.</strong></p>      <p class="style10">As          the first webmaster and designer at Caltech, I collaborated extensively          with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional material,          both online and in print. I served as designer and editor of          the original Caltech Alumni Newsletter, supervised staff and also taught          classes in  design. Also, as a native Spanish          speaker, I translated documents and facilitated bilingual discussions        for geologists conducting research in Mexico. I have also translated        into Spanish many web sites for Shopsports.com and VictorySweepers.com.</p>      <p class="style10">I believe my design        skills and effective communication skills        will be a valuable asset to your group. You mentioned possible teaching        opportunities with your colleagues and I am very interested. Thanks        again, I look forward to meeting with you on July 30 at 1pm.</p>      <p><span class="style10">Sincerely,<br>      Beatrice Aispuro</span><br>    </p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="188" rowspan="3" valign="top"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/resume/vi.html" target="_blank"><br>    </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/resume/vi.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../images/besig_wht.gif" width="103" height="180" border="0"></a></font></p>    </td>    <td height="77" colspan="3" align="left" valign="top"><div align="left" class="bod">      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1">::</span></font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <a href="../../../pdf/aispuro_cv.pdf" target="_parent">cv<br>        </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1">:: </span></font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/index.html" target="_blank">web          site</a></font><br>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1">::</span></font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <a href="../../../wtp/index.html" target="_blank">recent        designs</a></font><br>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1">::</span></font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <a href="../../../clients/dolce/index.html" target="_blank">recent        comps</a></font><br>    </div></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="132" align="left" valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1">::          local site designs</span></font></td>    <td width="138" colspan="2" rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1"><a href="http://www.whitetigerprinting.com" target="_blank">White            Tiger Printing</a><br>    </span><a href="http://www.victorysweepers.com" target="_blank">Victory    Sweepers, Inc.</a></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="left" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?hasley,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/hasley_homes.html" width="31" height="32"></body></html>
