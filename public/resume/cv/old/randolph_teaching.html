Thank you for showing          me around and introducing me to your staff. Randolph reminds me of          my elementary school, San Gabriel Adventist Academy in California.          I was very impressed with the quality of instruction and the well-rounded          program exhibited at your school.          </font></p>      <p><font color="#000033" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I          am interested in applying for a Spanish teaching position and substitute        teaching at Randolph. I          received my Bachelor of Arts degree from CSULB in Journalism and minor          in Spanish in 1991. Since attending Art Center College of Design in          Pasadena and beginning my web/graphic design career many years ago,          I have had the opportunity to work for many design firms in a variety        of capacities. </font></p>      <p><font color="#000033" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As           the first webmaster and designer at Caltech, I collaborated extensively           with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional material,           both online and in print. <strong>I also taught classes for staff           and students in constructing web pages, scanning, photographic manipulation,        and design. As            a native Spanish speaker, I was responsible for translating documents            and facilitating bilingual discussions for Caltech </strong></font><font color="000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font color="#000033">geologists            conducting research in Mexico.</font><font color="#330066"> At Shopsports.com, I translated all            store web sites into Spanish.
