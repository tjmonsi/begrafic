Our discussion was very enjoyable and             gave me a clear understanding of what this position entails. Teaching             a broad range of software applications (Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver)             sounds interesting and challenging. <br>            <br>            I am interested in the Corporate Training position, which you said             paid $20/hour. I have submitted applications to several colleges in             Orange County and have found that community colleges in California             typically pay between $32-55/hour. I would be willing to accept $30/hour             for the Corporate Training teaching position.</font></p>          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999933" size="3">I             am confident that, should you decide to hire me, I will be capable             of taking on all of the responsibilities that this position requires,             acquiring and improving new skills, and meeting challenges and deadlines             in a professional manner.</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" color="#999933" size="3">             I look forward to hearing from you soon</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="3">.             <br>            </font></p>          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="3"><font color="#999933">Sincerely,             <br>            beatrice</font></font></p>          </blockquote>      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr>  <tr bordercolor="0">     <td background="../../../images/yellowroses.jpeg" width="741" height="362">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?mmithx,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/mmi.thx.html"></body></html>
