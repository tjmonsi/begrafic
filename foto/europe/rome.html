      story:</strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On
          my second trip to Roma, en route to Rhodes, I was there for only one
          afternoon looking for a place to change the last of my dollars. I checked
          into the youth hostel and proceeded downtown to find currency exchange.
          I passed Plaza Venezia then explored a little capilla across the way
          for some meditation and a prayer asking for protection. I was venturing
          off to Greece with only $40 in cash.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When
        I exited the church there was a congested boulevard of
        cars and scooters to cross. I waited for traffic to die
        down then noticed a little old man standing beside me. I asked him
        if he was also attempting to cross
        &quot;la strada.&quot; He proceeded to tell me the history of the Mussolini
        museum across the street, which is where Mussolini was killed. Not sure
        that I understood all of his storytelling, but parlare Italiano I needed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I
        smiled and nodded taking it all in. Fifteen minutes later we
        crossed two stradas. <font color="#003366">As I gave my farewell, he asked if I wanted  a
          shot of espresso. We entered a nearby cafe for our fix. I told Mario,
          this 85-year old Italian, that I was on my way to find a money exchange
          place. Mario decided to accompany me and directed
          me to his bank far away. va bene! </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
          we walked, my tour guide  told me everything there was
          to know about Roman history. I realized my Italian was a bit rusty!
          We arrived at his bank to find it chiuso (closed), but I noticed a
          Western Union across the way. I said my goodbyes once again, but Mario
          insisted on coming along. Va bene,,, Western Union is not a good place
          to exchange! They charge a high commission, but when there isn't much,
          it doesn't really matter.  I took my 40 Euros and we exited. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#003366" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
        thanked Mario for his help and turned to leave, then Mario took out
        his wallet and handed me a crisp 50 Euro bill. &quot;Perque??,&quot; I
        asked in amazement,,,</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Why are you giving me this? I wasn't sure that I could
          accept it. Mario responded... &quot;I am retired, I don't need it, you need it.</font>&quot;</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WOW,,,
        I couldn't believe it. My $40 turned to 90 Euros. Truly, I was blessed. &nbsp;KARMA.</font></p></td>
