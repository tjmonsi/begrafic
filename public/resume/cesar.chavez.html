Chavez Foundation through monster.com. I received my Bachelor         of Arts degree from CSULB in Journalism/Public Relations in 1991. I have         been working in web and graphic design for the past ten years, while keeping         abreast of the latest software and design techniques. I have excellent         organizational and analytical skills, and I can set priorities and meet         deadlines in a professional manner.<font color="#333333"> </font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333">As         my resume shows, I am well versed in html and design programs including         Photoshop, Illustrator, Quark, Pagemaker, and Dreamweaver. I believe my         web design skills, my project management experience, and my design sense         as it applies to typography, photography, and creative imagery will be         a valuable asset to your group. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333">As         the first designer and webmaster at Caltech, I collaborated extensively         with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional material,         both online and in print. I served as designer and editor of the original         Caltech Alumni Newsletter and also taught classes for our staff, faculty,         and students in constructing web pages using H<font color="#000066">TML         code, image scanning/manipulation, and creative design.

During that time,         I represented Entergate Communications at the COMDEX computer show in         Goteburg, Sweden, developed de</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">signs         for clients in Italy, Spain, and Holland, and took hundreds of digital         photographs of classic architecture, art, and people. I was privileged         to visit many impressive museums like the Louvre in Paris and the Uffizi         in Florence. All of these experiences have filled me with fresh creative         insights, ideas, and perspectives. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Now         that I have returned, I am full of energy and inspiration.
