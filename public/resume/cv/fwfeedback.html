      Dear Mr. Higinio de Le&oacute;n,</p>
      <p>1. Client consultation and Project Brief<br>
        From an in-depth discussion with the client to determine its requirements you will write the Project Brief that will include a site map, a description of the content, final timelines and detailed cost breakdown.</p>
      <p>2. Design direction and development<br>
        How many different styles of design will you be providing? How will they be presented - in person, in print or online? Once a design has been chosen, explain your acceptance process - signing off either by email or in writing - and that this is the point where you start creating all the other pages of the site.</p>
      <p>3. Prototype<br>
        When the design direction and development is completed and signed off is the point when the technical stuff happens in earnest - the HTML is built and populated with content that has either been provided by the client or generated by a third party.</p>
      <p>4. Implementation<br>
        Describe the full list of deliverables so there are no nasty surprises for either you or the client. Manage their expectations by stating explicitly what you will and what you won't be providing.</p>
      <p>Development Budget<br>
        Bear in mind that as this is a Proposal the Development Budget should be followed by the caveat that further discussion will be necessary to determine a final cost, which would be detailed in the Project Brief. At this stage it's enough to give an estimate.</p>
      <p>Definitions<br>
        Even these days there are many clients who may not understand some of the expressions that we take for granted because we use them every day. Explain to them in layman's terms what a server is, the purpose of a site map, what a content management system is. It may be useful to explain the different technologies you'll be using - basic HTML, Java Script, Perl, ASP, etc.</p>
      <p>Make the language accessible, as clients can feel intimidated by technology. You can use this as an opportunity to show them that they'll be comfortable working with you.</p>
      <p>Fee Schedule<br>
        Very rarely will you find a client who will pay you on time, so it's up to you inform them at what stages during a project you want to be compensated. I unusually break down my required fee schedule into three equal parts: one third when the Project Brief is signed off; one third when the design direction has been agreed and signed off; and the final third upon completion.</p>
      <p>There are designers who insist on the first portion of their fee before the Project Brief is agreed. However, some clients are wary of shelling out before they've seen any work from the designer - even if it's written and not creative. Play it by ear to gauge how twitchy the client is about this and then decide if you're willing to compromise.</p>
      <p>Development Schedule<br>
        Provide a timeline for the project, listing dates for the various stages of delivery, how long the client has to provide feedback, all the way up to final acceptance and sign off. This is important to show that you are focussed on reaching a goal and a deadline.</p>
      <p>Point out that although this is a provisional timeline - the final one should be in the Project Brief - any deviation from it by the client may have repercussion on your ability to complete the project in time. How many times has a client made eleventh hour changes or changed the brief but still expected you to meet the agreed deadline? This is one way of showing that the client has as much responsibility for the success of the project as you do.</p>
      <p>Conclusion<br>
        Thank the client for the opportunity to provide a proposal and tell them that you're sure you can meet all their requirements. You could also briefly mention what differentiates you from other potential suppliers.</p>
      <p>Team Biographies<br>
        Mention the key personnel who will be involved with the project, giving their names and job titles. Give a brief professional biography for each team member concentrating on relevant previous experience. If you are partnering with someone else for the project, then use this opportunity to describe briefly how you have worked together before.</p>
      <p>Make it clear which member of your team is the primary contact for when the client has general queries. For specialist queries - such as design or development - you may want to point out whom they should cont</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>1.       redesigning the website and establishing an extensive Facebook presence</p>
      <p>2.       designating a PR person to contact local businesses</p>
      <p>3.       offering discounts and other incentives to attendees</p>
      <p>4.       and allowing local hotels to boost their business by attracting tourists to the festival.</p>
      <p>Improvements that can be made for future festivals include creating an exclusive F&amp;W-Ixtapa website with social networking capabilities +blog built right into the site. All attendees can follow FB for festival updates before, during, and after each event. It would easily enable you to announce venue or occupancy changes if FB is an integral part of the F&amp;W-Ixtapa site.</p>
      <p>Also, by having a unique portal and FB presence specifically for the event, you could keep the excitement going year-round. You can track site traffic to gauge interest and use SEO/SEM strategies to capitalize on festival searches. As an attendee, I would have liked to learn more about featured chefs and winemakers. I designed much collateral for the Paso Robles Vintners &amp; Growers Association and am interested in contacting several of the Baja wineries.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the same excitement, F&amp;W-Ixtapa could follow up with attendees on FB by posting pictures, recipes, and links to chefs and winemakers at the event. I know I would enjoy seeing photos of events that I wasn't able to attend as well as gathering showcased recipes, which would eliminate the need for printouts by your crew. Occasional FB entries throughout the year could help bring people back again and again.</p>
      <p>Facebook is a GREAT TOOL because as we're inundated with spam, few want that extra email. On the other hand, Facebook publishes news in a non-invasive manner; people tune in at their convenience, and provide valuable exchange. Plus when someone becomes a fan, it freely advertises to hundreds of their friends. The average person has 300+ friends.</p>
      <p>I also found that local businesses here don't keep up with current events, since nobody with whom I talked knew ANYTHING about the festival. As discussed, the publicity was posted. However, people just don't pay attention. Perhaps there could be a PR person who could take a grassroots approach in talking to local restaurants, bars, and stores promoting the event and distributing print collateral.</p>
      <p>There could be an incentive for businesses to publicize the event with posters and flyers, if, in exchange, they would offer wristband holders a discount of some sort. This would create a more festive environment and encourage more involvement. People with wristbands will feel special. Maybe provide a unique wristband for people who attend five or more economical sessions to encourage that extra sale.</p>
      <p>Every hotel in Ixtapa, whether participating or not, should have posters advertising the festival to their guests. I also think that greater effort should be made to convince these non-participating hotels that it is in THEIR BEST INTEREST to support and promote the event with the common goal of bringing new tourism to Ixtapa.</p>
      <p>Events like the Food &amp; Wine Festival help the community as a whole, not just certain businesses. It could become a TRADITION. Now is the time to embrace and nurture this special opportunity. Make it the OUTSTANDING Food &amp; Wine Festival to attend.</p>
      <p>When I arrived for the festival I thought that there would be a more festive environment throughout the town, but that simply was not the case. Not even the finest hotels could provide me with any useful information. Understandably, being the first ever, people didn't comprehend what it was all about. Now that the festival has been documented, it will prove easier to publicize using photos, videos, and more detailed descriptions.</p>
      <p>Like I mentioned earlier, it was quite frustrating navigating the CVB site to purchase tickets, since the initial screen defaulted to hotel searches. Although that issue was immediately resolved after I emailed staffers about the problem, other site problems still exist, which make it difficult to read descriptions when making final selections.</p>
      <p>I can help you recreate a whole new interface that would be informative, intuitive, and elegant. Let me know of any specific capabilities that you're interested in including in the new F&amp;W portal so that I can give you a better cost estimate. I tried accessing the Food &amp; Wine section of the CVB site, but it was already taken down.</p>
      <p>Like you said, once the dust settles, it's time to get to work on perfecting next year's festival. Thanks again for the opportunity to convey my ideas and impressions of such an extraordinary event.</p>
      <p>I am still researching site capabilities, estimating time and costs. I will have a project estimate ready for you in the next few days.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Thanks kindly,<br>
