Since attending Art Center College of Design in Pasadena         and beginning my graphic/web design career many years ago, I have had         the opportunity to work for many design firms in a variety of capacities.         While I have not taught in an academic setting, I have had vast experience         teaching in an industry setting. Not only have I conducted classes in         design and software use, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660000">but         I have worked one-on-one with students in hands-on learning situations,         some of which required my bilingual skills. These experiences have increased         my desire to become involved in a formal teaching environment where I         can share with today's students the skills and knowledge they will need         to be successful in graphic design--a field in which I have already worked         for nearly a decade. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660000">I         have served as project manager for four separate organizations, as well         as design instructor for a number of web design firms. As the first designer         and webmaster at the California Institute of Technology, I collaborated         extensively with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional         <font color="#990000">material, both online and in print. I also served         as designer and editor of the GPS Alumni news</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990000">letter.         In addition, I have had extensive experience in media planning as well         as in writing, editing, and designing various forms of advertisement,         news articles, and informative publications. Finally, as a native Spanish         speaker, I was responsible for translating documents for GPS geologists         conducting research in Mexico and translating an entire web site into         Spanish for Shopsports.com. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990000">I         am extremely proficient in Photoshop, Image Ready, Illustrator, Dreamweaver,         and Quark XPress. I am also capable of working on both Windows and Macintosh         platforms. I believe my web design skills, my project management experience,         and my design sense as it applies to typography, photography, and creative         imagery will be a valuable asset to your students. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333366">January         through July of this year, I traveled all over Europe&#150;Sweden, France,         Italy, Holland, Spain, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland. During that time,         I represented Entergate Communications at the COMDEX computer show in         Goteburg, Sweden, developed designs for clients in Italy, Spain, and Holland,         and took hundreds of photographs of classic architecture, art, and people.         I was privileged to visit many impressive museums like the Louvre in Paris         and the Uffizi in Florence. All of these experiences have filled me with         fresh creative insights, ideas, and perspectives. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333366"> Now         that I have returned, I am full of energy and inspiration; I am ready         for full-time work and a chance to settle down. Thank you for taking the         time to review my qualifications. I look forward to speaking with you         soon.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333366">Sincerely,<br>        Beatrice Aispuro</font></p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr align="center" valign="middle">     <td><img name="Image3" border="0" src="../../../images/besig-yelo.gif" width="75" height="169"></td>    <td width="266">       <pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660066"><a href="../../../protrans/brochure.html" target="_blank">self-mailer/brochure</a></font></pre>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660066"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/e411/images/comps2/event.html" target="_blank">event411         designs</a></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660066"><a href="../../../logo_design.html" target="_blank">logos</a></font></p>      <p><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="resume_teaching.html" target="_blank">resume</a>         | <a href="../../../index.html" target="_blank"> web site</a></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#660066"><a href="../salary.history.html" target="_blank">salary         history</a></font> </p>      </td>    <td width="269" colspan="3" rowspan="2">       <center>        <a href="http://www.begrafic.com/resume/vi.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../../images/bewd-med.gif" width="135" height="68" border="0"></a>       </center>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="532" colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?westwoodcollege,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/westwood.college.html"> </body></html>
