I am very interested in working with a company         that has, not only opportunities for work with high-tech hardware and         software programs, but opportunity for international travel.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000033">I         have worked in computer-related positions for more than a decade using         numerous software applications and hardware equipment. (I am indeed familiar         with QuickShip, the thermal transfer printer which prints the barcode         labels, and the web-based computer tracking sequence.) I have served as         project and office manager for four separate organizations, as well as         design instructor for a number of web design firms.<font color="#330066">         I have also been responsible for creating, maintaining, and tracking corporate         and government-funded budgets using spreadsheet applications. </font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330066">Having         worked so extensively with computer hardware and software, I am a quick         study on virtually any new software or hardware I encounter. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330066">I         have worked on different Windows-based machines, from Windows 3.1 to Windows         2000. I have had substantial experience installing and training staff         on a host of applications and platforms. I began coding web pages on the         Unix system, solved numerous computer problems, restructured division         web sites, and implemented new web directory structure and design for         the California Institute of Technology, Geological and Planetary Sciences         Division.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330066">In         addition, I have had vast experience teaching and giving educational presentations         in an industry setting. Not only have I conducted classes in design and         software use, but I have worked one-on-one with students in hands-on learning         situations,</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330033">         some of which required my bilingual skills. When I worked for Caltech,         part of my duties included translating documents for GPS geologists conducting         research in Mexico and serving as translator.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330033">I         am extremely fluent in English and Spanish, having spoken both languages         my whole life. I have also studied Italian over the past two years. I         believe that the numerous positions I've held working with computers,         teaching, giving presentations, and interacting with people from various         backgrounds combined with my multi-lingual skills make me an ideal candidate         for this position. I am very excited about the prospect of living and         working overseas doing what I've always loved doing--working with computers         and working with people. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330033">I         am eager to hear back from you and look forward to speaking with you further         about this position. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330033">Sincerely,</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#330033">Beatrice         Aispuro</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="bottom"><img name="Image3" border="0" src="../../../images/besig-yelo.gif" width="75" height="169"></td>    <td valign="middle" width="266" align="center">       <pre><font color="#660066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><a href="../index.html"><font size="-1"> resume </font></a><font size="-1">  <a href="../../../index.html"> web site </a> </font></font></pre>    </td>    <td width="269" valign="middle" colspan="3" rowspan="2" align="center">       <center>        <a href="../../../index.html"><img src="../../../images/bewd-grn.gif" width="91" height="44" border="0"></a>       </center>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="532" colspan="2"><font color="660066" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;       </font></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?fedex,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/fedex.europe.html"></body></html>
