I was looking forward to meeting you because I was         very impressed with what I learned about your group from the website.         I went to New York over the weekend and had a chance to visit the Guggenheim         while I was there. (I regret not being able to chat with you about it!)         It was amazing, overwhelming. I am more impressed with Frank Lloyd Wright's         work than I ever was before. I notice a definite similarity between yours         and Wright's philosophy of design----that every element in the design         matters----for Wright, to render the most aesthetic and useful living         experience; for you and your company, to help your clients make the most         effective impact on their customers. I respect that approach very much.</font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">Esteban mentioned that         one of the first responsibilities of your new hire would be to help tackle         a backlog of work that you have. If there is anything I can do to help,         I would consider it a pleasure to do contract/freelance work for you.         Please do keep me in mind. </font></p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="141">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="457">      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">Sincerely, </font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">Beatrice Aispuro </font></p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="141" align="right"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com"><img src="../../../images/bewd-blu2.gif" width="91" height="44" border="0"></a></td>    <td width="457" align="center"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">       <font size="-1">b e g r a f i c . c o m </font></font></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; </p><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?ea,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/ea.html"></body></html>
