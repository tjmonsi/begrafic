I have been working in web         and graphic design for the past twelve years, while keeping abreast of         the latest software and design techniques. I have strong written/verbal         communication skills and I can set priorities and <font color="#333333">meet         deadlines in a professional manner. </font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333">As         my resume shows, I am well versed in design programs including Photoshop,         Illustrator, Quark, Acrobat, and Dreamweaver.&nbsp; I believe my web design         skills, my project management experience, and my design sense as it applies         to typography, photography, and creative imagery will be a valuable asset         to your group. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#333333">As         the first designer and webmaster at Caltech, I collaborated extensively         with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional material,         both online and in print. I served as designer and editor of the original         Caltech Alumni Newsletter and also taught classes for our staff, faculty,         and students in constructing web pages using H<font color="#000066">TML         code, image scanning/manipulation, and creative design. In addition,</font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000066">         as a native Spanish speaker, I was responsible for translating documents         and facilitating bilingual discussions for our geologists conducting research         in Mexico.

During that time,         I represented Entergate Communications at the COMDEX computer show in         Goteburg, Sweden, developed de</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">signs         for clients in Italy, Spain, and Holland, and took hundreds of digital         photographs of classic architecture, art, and people. I was privileged         to visit many impressive museums like the Louvre in Paris and the Uffizi         in Florence. All of these experiences have filled me with fresh creative         insights, ideas, and perspectives. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Now         that I have returned, I am full of energy and inspiration.
