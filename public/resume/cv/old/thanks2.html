The more         I learned about your group, the more convinced I became that working with         you would be the ideal arrangement for me. </font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">While I would be interested         in the webmaster position, I believe that my experience and areas of expertise         and interest make me ideally suited for the creative director position.         I would be eager to lead the graphic design team in accomplishing a number         of immediate goals, some of which include establishing the Traffic Station         brand name with a new logo and identity, as well as designing a new look         and cohesive feel to the entire site. I also believe that an intranet         and/or printed newsletter for clients, investors, and government groups         would establish greater continuity in Traffic Station's public relations         efforts. </font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">In addition, I can         help in translating new sites into Spanish for Traffic Station's Florida,         New York, Chicago and LA markets. My journalism background has given me         an excellent eye for editing, both in English and Spanish.</font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1"> The broad range of         creative possibilities makes this job very appealing. I have always enjoyed         being a part of collaborative projects, and I feel that I could contribute         a lot of energy and enthusiasm toward the work assigned me.</font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1"> I am confident that,         should you decide to hire me as creative director, I will be capable of         taking on all of the responsibilities that this position requires, acquiring         and improving new skills, and meeting challenges and deadlines in a professional         manner. Thanks again for your time. I look forward to hearing from you         soon. </font></p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="205">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="216">       <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">Sincerely, </font></p>      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1">Beatrice Aispuro </font></p>    </td>    <td width="219">       <p>&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="205" align="right"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com"><img src="../../../images/bewd-blu2.gif" width="91" height="44" border="0"></a></td>    <td width="216" align="center"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><font size="-1"><img src="../../../images/besig-blu.gif" width="75" height="169"></font></font></td>    <td width="219" align="center">       <pre><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com"> b e g r a f i c . c o m </a></font><a href="http://www.begrafic.com"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font></a></pre>      <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&nbsp; </font></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?geoff,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/traffic.station.html"></body></html>
