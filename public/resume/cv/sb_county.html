    <td height="413" colspan="5" valign="top"> <p class="bod"><font color="#000066"> I am interested in applying for the Public Information Officer position. This sounds like the ideal job for me because I have extensive Public Relations, Journalism, Design, and Communications experience.  I am capable of developing and administering a program fostering public understanding of County goals, policies, programs and services. </font><font color="#000066"></font></p>
      <p class="bod"> I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from California State University, Long Beach in Journalism, Public Relations, and Spanish in 1991 and completed coursework at Art Center College of Design in 1997. As Assistant Public Relations Director during my internship at the Southeast Council on Alcoholism &amp; Drug Problems in Downey, I successfully published several articles, which received program donations. I organized fundraising events and maintained effective working relations with representatives of the various media.</p>
      <p class="bod">Throughout my fifteen-year career,
        I have been involved in the planning and management of hundreds of
        outstanding outreach projects.&nbsp; I have extensive experience
        designing print and web collateral, maintaining a social presence for employers and re-branding corporate identities. </p>
      <p class="bod">I have developed successful marketing and outreach campaigns, and produced
        numerous websites. In addition to superior
        research and analytical skills, I am capable of managing multiple projects
        and delivering quality work while meeting deadlines successfully.</p>
      <p class="bod">I am extremely
        well-organized, resourceful, proactive, and energetic. I
        have always enjoyed being a part of collaborative projects, and I feel
        that I could contribute a lot of energy and enthusiasm toward the work
        assigned me.<font color="#000066"> I believe my unique public relations skills, my project management experience,
          and my design sense as it applies to typography, photography and creative
          imagery will be a valuable asset to the County of San Bernardino. </font></p>
      <p class="bod"><font color="#000066">Thanks again for your time. I look forward
        to hearing from you soon.</font></p>
