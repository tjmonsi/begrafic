    <td class="body"><p>My parents emigrated from Mexico in 1954 and settled
        near downtown Los Angeles.&nbsp; The neighborhood and nearby public schools
        were gang-ridden, so my father&mdash;wanting the best for us&mdash;sacrificed
        greatly to send us to private school.&nbsp; My childhood had its usual
        ups and downs, and I did well in school.&nbsp; However, during my junior
        year of high school, I experienced a traumatic life-changing event.&nbsp; While
        driving with my family to Mexico for a wedding, our brand new Ford Bronco
        had a blowout and rolled over.&nbsp; My 2-year-old niece and I were in
        a coma for a week.&nbsp; When I emerged from the coma, doctors at Scripps
        Hospital immediately performed brain surgery.&nbsp; I was paralyzed on
        the left side and had a broken pelvis, ribs, clavicle, and skull, so
        I had to learn how to walk all over again.&nbsp; I recovered and left
        the hospital two months later.&nbsp; Thereafter, my family filed a lawsuit
        against the auto company&mdash;at that time, one of the first lawsuits
        for faulty tires.&nbsp; However, the ordeal would take five years and
        prove to be fruitless&mdash;a devastating experience, both emotionally
        and financially for me and my family.</p>
      <p>After graduating from high school, I enrolled at San Diego State University.&nbsp; I
        was determined to overcome all obstacles and become the first in my family
        to graduate from college.&nbsp; While attending classes at California
        State University, Long Beach, I took a semester off from school to go
        to court with my family. The jury trial lasted 12 weeks.&nbsp; Things
        were going very well for us, and we were confident we would win the case.&nbsp; However,
        at the end of the trial, the judge suddenly changed the jury&rsquo;s
        instructions making it impossible for us to win.&nbsp; My family and
        I lost the lawsuit and received nothing for our medical expenses.&nbsp; I
        came to the painful realization that justice is not always served.&nbsp; Justice
        often exists only for those who can afford it.&nbsp; Truth can become
        a casualty against corruption and greed. Regardless, I had to set aside
        my family&rsquo;s loss and the injustice we had suffered, and continue
        to excel in my journalism studies.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> In 1991, after receiving my
        bachelor's degree in journalism/public relations (with a minor in Spanish)
        from CSULB, I began my first job as program director for the American
        Language Center with UCLA.&nbsp; Soon after,
        I became the first webmaster at Caltech.&nbsp; There was only one website
        in existence at the time, which was the Super Computer Center at Urbana-Champaign
        (creators of Mosaic).&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In those early days, the concept of FTP and coding HTML using vi on
        a UNIX machine was intensely difficult, but I managed to teach myself
        everything I needed to know to build a website.&nbsp; Within one month's
        time, I created the first site for the Geological &amp; Planetary
        Sciences Division.&nbsp; I later redesigned it, and created a second
        site, this time for the Seismological Laboratory.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>I designed logos and building signage.&nbsp; To raise funds from alumni,
        I was asked to design the first Caltech
        Alumni Newsletter for the GPS
        Division.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, I trained staff members across campus how
        to write code and design a newsletter and website for their division.&nbsp; To
        sharpen my skills further, I took several courses at <a href="http://artcenter.edu/" target="_blank">Art
        Center College of Design</a> including photography, package design, Photoshop, Quark, and
        Illustrator.&nbsp; I attended national web seminars.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>After five years at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Caltech</a>, I found my niche, what I loved to do most&mdash; DESIGN.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before
        leaving Caltech, I was offered a design job at the San Jose Mercury News
        in the Silicon Valley.&nbsp; However, once I moved, I was told that the
        design position at the SJMN was terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless,
        I did some consulting work for them and worked temporarily at Netscape.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>I then moved closer to the coast and secured a position as a webmaster/designer
        at the San Francisco Unified School District's Language Academy.&nbsp; Eventually,
        I returned to Southern California-to be closer to my family-and worked
        at several IPO's.&nbsp; I also continued my own design business, consulting
        for other departments at Caltech.<br />
        <br />
        Then began one of the most exciting times of my life!&nbsp; From January
        to July of 2002, I traveled through <a href="http://www.begrafic.com/foto/europe/" target="_blank">Europe</a>, visiting Sweden, France,
        Italy, Holland, Spain, Greece, Germany, and Switzerland. During that
        time, I developed designs for a few European businesses, one of which
        is Entergate Technologies in Sweden.&nbsp; In Madrid, I rented an apartment
        for several months and developed a great love and appreciation for my
        Spanish heritage and culture.&nbsp; I enjoyed very much exploring my
        Basque roots in Bilbao and San Sebastian. </p>
      <p>I visited several Spanish museums&mdash;the Dali museum in Figueras,
        the Prado Museum in Madrid, and the Picasso museums in Malaga and Barcelona&mdash;and
        found them to be profoundly inspiring and full of rich culture.&nbsp; All
        of these experiences, as well as my experiences with the people, filled
        me with fresh creative insights, innovative ideas, and more intimate
        perspectives. <br />
        When I returned from Europe, I continued my consulting business and worked
        at Foxsports.com as photo editor.&nbsp; I moved to Huntsville, Alabama
        last year in search of better design opportunities.&nbsp; I am currently
        designing for a large printing company called White Tiger Printing.&nbsp; As
        Webmaster/Art Director I have created for them a new
        identity branding campaign, a new  website, and designed <a href="http://www.begrafic.com/wtp" target="_blank">ads,
        folders, stationary, brochures, and calendars</a>.</p>
      <p>The past 13 years have flown by.&nbsp; And I'm asking myself once again
        what I really want to do with my life.&nbsp; I half-answered the question
        long ago when I knew my talents lay in the field of design.&nbsp; But
        I also know that I love to work with people, those who have great talent
        and those with great potential.&nbsp; These realizations have led me
        to the next step, one that excites me and motivates me&mdash;I want to
        teach!&nbsp; I want to share the things I've learned and the experiences
        I've had.&nbsp; I have learned to recognize talent in those I've worked
        with over the years, and I want to cultivate those gifts and talents
        in young people who are just getting started.</p>
      <p>I want to go back and earn a master&rsquo;s degree in Graphic Design
        in the one place where I felt the most personal connection and inspiration-Spain.
        I LOVED Barcelona!&nbsp; The culture, art, architecture and people were
        amazing.&nbsp; But I also feel a tremendous responsibility to immerse
        myself in another culture as I gain more education.&nbsp; As the world
        learns to communicate more and more on a global level, it becomes the
        responsibility of those who help facilitate that communication, artists
        and designers included, to do it well.&nbsp; I want to be one of those
        people.&nbsp; My personal life experiences have given me compassion for
        those who are underprivileged and need to be heard.&nbsp; And my professional
        life experiences have given me the expertise and proficiency to give
        a voice to those who need it. I ask the Fulbright committee to consider
        my application for a scholarship-and make one of the most precious dreams
        of my life come true. </p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br />
      Beatrice Aispuro</p>
