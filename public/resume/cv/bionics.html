I told        him that you speak some Spanish and you guys could probably understand        each other just fine. I also mentioned that a photo of his leg/thigh        would be helpful so that you can better estimate the costs involved (since        his primary question was regarding cost).</p>      <p>Whenever necessary, I can assist in translating. He can phone me, I        can call you and merge the calls. This is helpful when detailed explanations        are necessary. My cell number is 323.578.8995. Feel free to        call me anytime. I will also put some of my cards in the mail for you.</p>      <p>Regarding your site: I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a horrific        looking site, however, it is a bit messy. It is the details that make        a site look totally pro vs. not bad. </p>      <p><strong>Constructive Critique::</strong><br>        There are spacing issues on different          pages. The top graphic sometimes puts the html text beneath the graphic          so the entire text is not totally visible. There is a mix of serif          and sans-serif fonts. T<span class="style27">he photographs of people look bland (not properly          color-corrected) and they weren't isolated from their background very          well;  pixelization around the body and hair (even bullets          on nav bar appear pixelated). </span></p>      <p class="style27">The colors are a bit &quot;clinical,&quot; and          often don't match each other and there are          not enough inspiring photos of people. People like to see pictures          of people they can relate with. The more pictures you show them, the        more they can see themselves there.</p>      <p><span class="style27">At all of the dot.coms I worked at, and there          were far more than on my resume, we used the color ORANGE a lot. Studies          show that the colors of the SUN make people feel good, cheerful, alive,,,          Very often I was forced to stay away from BLUES as they emit bland,          depressing feelings. </span><span class="style33">These companies spent          a lot on research. You see successful businesses like AT&amp;T, CNN          Morning Express, etc. use mostly ORANGE/YELLOWS. (just an fyi).. I        noticed your site is mostly blue/purple/grey...</span></p>      <p class="style33">I definitely like the shapes used (Funny, b/c I used        a similar shape (curves) at the bottom of my <a href="http://www.casa121.com/kitchen.html" target="_blank">casa121        site</a>. Notice also, when I add an external link to my site, it automatically        opens up a new window. Your site has external links that will drive traffic        away from your site without a way to return. I doubt the user will hit        the back button hundreds of times to return to your site once they finish        looking through the site they navigated to from your site.</p>      <p><span class="style33">All in all, your site could use some fine-tuning          to make it SHOW OFF your work rather than merely explain it. I know          I could really make it classier and warmer. Also, as I mentioned, the          Hispanic market is huge and growing every day. If you taylored the          same site in Spanish for those people, your market would more than          double. Add to that weekly</span> or monthly        visits across the border, and your business would boom. </p>      <p>Regarding easy to remember &amp; spell domain names, I searched <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank">godaddy.com</a>        and found a few available domain names as an example of easier to spell:<br>        <strong>bionics</strong>sd.com, <strong>bionics</strong>123.com, <strong>bionics</strong>op.com,        <strong>bionico</strong>mx.com, protesis<strong>bionico</strong>.com. Like I mentioned,        getting several URLS and mirroring them to one hosted site is a good        way to capitalize on the search engine optimization.</p>      <p>I am very grateful already that you can advise and offer services        to my cousin, whom is very dear to me. Thanks for that.</p>      <p>I do miss San Diego. I really  love        it there. I attended SDSU for a couple of years 85-87. I wish I had never        left. I would like to take this opportunity to also share some of my        background. </p>      <p>I use Dreamweaver exclusively for        creating all web sites, often hand-coding HTML and CSS. I received my        Bachelor of Arts degree from California State University, Long Beach        in Journalism, Public Relations, and Spanish in 1991 and completed coursework        at Art Center College of Design in 1997. </p>      <p class="style10"><span class="style26">Throughout            my fifteen-year career, I have been involved in the planning and            management of hundreds of outstanding design and outreach projects.&nbsp; I          have extensive experience</span> <span class="style27">designing print and web collateral and re-branding            corporate identities. I have developed successful marketing and outreach            campaigns, and produced numerous web sites. In addition to superior            research and analytical skills, I            am capable of managing multiple projects and delivering quality work            while meeting deadlines successfully.</strong></span></p>      <p class="style34">As          the first webmaster and designer at Caltech, I collaborated extensively          with staff and faculty in creating and developing promotional material,          both online and in print. I served as          designer and editor of the original Caltech Alumni Newsletter, supervised          staff and also taught classes in design. Also, as a native Spanish          speaker, I translated documents and facilitated bilingual discussions        for geologists conducting research in Mexico. I translated        several storefront sites (MLB/Copeland's/Victory) into Spanish.</p>      <p class="style27">I am fluent on mac/pc/unix platforms and have done        extensive troubleshooting on cross-platform/cross-browser issues. I am        extremely well-organized, resourceful, proactive, and energetic. I believe        my design skills, project management experience, and effective communication        skills make me a valuable asset to your group. Please let me know if you        would like to get started on fixing up your site, and/or translating it      into Spanish.</p>      <p class="style27">Kind regards,<br>        Beatrice Aispuro<br>          </p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="188" rowspan="3" valign="top"> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/resume/vi.html" target="_blank"><br>    </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/resume/vi.html" target="_blank"><img src="../images/besig_wht.gif" width="103" height="180" border="0"></a></font></p>    </td>    <td height="77" colspan="3" align="left" valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">::</font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <a href="../../pdf/aispuro_cv.pdf" target="_blank">cv<br>    </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">:: </font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/index.html" target="_blank">portfolio / web          site</a><a href="../wtp/index.html" target="_blank"><br>          </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">:: </font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/clients/lightcraft" target="_blank">brochure redesign</a></font><br>          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">:: </font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/clients/fy" target="_blank" class="style16">logos / yellow page ads</a></font><br>          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">:: </font><font color="#660066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.begrafic.com/web/ss1.html" target="_blank">portal design &amp; translation</a></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width="132" align="left" valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style22">::    recent sites</span></font></td>    <td width="138" colspan="2" rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="style1"><a href="http://www.aestheticprosthetics.com/clients/index.html" target="_blank">Aesthetic          Prosthetics</a><br>    </span><a href="http://www.victorysweepers.com" target="_blank">Victory    Sweepers, Inc.</a></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="left" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><IMG SRC="http://www.begrafic.com/cgi-bin/makelog.pl?bionics,http://www.begrafic.com/resume/cv/bionics.html" width="31" height="32"></body></html>
