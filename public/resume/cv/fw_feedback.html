      Dear Mr. Higinio de Le&oacute;n,</p>
      <p align="left" class="style11">I posted my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150143978323675&set=a.10150143959253675.299901.526003674&theater" target="_blank">festival photos</a> on VisitIxtapaZihuatanejo's wall, then found several other Ixtapa Facebook (FB) accounts.  I'm still unclear as to which is which. Perhaps this could be clarified better with <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/24/more-new-facebook-profiles-pics/#64174-Cyril-Boggs-Serrano" target="_blank">unique FB customization</a>. Also, check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cocacola?ref=ts" target="_blank">Coca Cola's FB page</a> for other content ideas.  In addition, I&rsquo;d like to share in detail my ideas on the following:</p>
      <p>1.       redesigning the website and establishing an extensive Facebook presence</p>
      <p>2.       designating a PR person to contact local businesses</p>
      <p>3.       offering discounts and other incentives to attendees</p>
      <p>4.       allowing local hotels to boost their business by attracting tourists to the festival</p>
      <p>Improvements that can be made for future festivals include creating an exclusive F&amp;W-Ixtapa website with social networking capabilities +blog built right into the site. All attendees can follow FB for festival updates before, during, and after each event. It would easily enable you to announce venue or occupancy changes if FB is an integral part of the F&amp;W-Ixtapa site.</p>
      <p>Also, by having a unique portal and FB presence specifically for the event, you could keep the excitement going year-round. You can track site traffic to gauge interest and use SEO/SEM strategies to capitalize on festival searches. As an attendee, I would have liked to learn more about featured chefs and winemakers. I designed much collateral for the Paso Robles Vintners &amp; Growers Association and am interested in contacting several of the Baja wineries.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the same excitement, F&amp;W-Ixtapa could follow up with attendees on FB by posting pictures, recipes, and links to chefs and winemakers at the event. I know I would enjoy seeing photos of events that I wasn't able to attend as well as gathering showcased recipes, which would eliminate the need for printouts by your crew. Occasional FB entries throughout the year could help bring people back again and again.</p>
      <p>Facebook is a GREAT TOOL because as we're inundated with spam, few want that extra email. On the other hand, Facebook publishes news in a non-invasive manner; people tune in at their convenience, and provide valuable exchange. Plus when someone becomes a fan, it freely advertises to hundreds of their friends. The average person has 300+ friends.</p>
      <p>I also found that local businesses here don't keep up with current events, since nobody with whom I talked knew ANYTHING about the festival. As discussed, the publicity was posted. However, people just don't pay attention. Perhaps there could be a PR person who could take a grassroots approach in talking to local restaurants, bars, and stores promoting the event and distributing print collateral.</p>
      <p>There could be an incentive for businesses to publicize the event with posters and flyers, if, in exchange, they would offer wristband holders a discount of some sort. This would create a more festive environment and encourage more involvement. People with wristbands will feel special. Maybe provide a unique wristband for people who attend five or more economical sessions to encourage that extra sale.</p>
      <p>Every hotel in Ixtapa, whether participating or not, should have posters advertising the festival to their guests. I also think that greater effort should be made to convince these non-participating hotels that it is in THEIR BEST INTEREST to support and promote the event with the common goal of bringing new tourism to Ixtapa.</p>
      <p>Events like the Food &amp; Wine Festival help the community as a whole, not just certain businesses. It could become a TRADITION. Now is the time to embrace and nurture this special opportunity. Make it the OUTSTANDING Food &amp; Wine Festival to attend.</p>
      <p>When I arrived for the festival I thought that there would be a more festive environment throughout the town, but that simply was not the case. Not even the finest hotels could provide me with any useful information. Understandably, being the first ever, people didn't comprehend what it was all about. Now that the festival has been documented, it will prove easier to publicize using photos, videos, and more detailed descriptions.</p>
      <p>Like I mentioned earlier, it was quite frustrating navigating the CVB site to purchase tickets, since the initial screen defaulted to hotel searches. Although that issue was immediately resolved after I emailed staffers about the problem, other site problems still exist, which make it difficult to read descriptions when making final selections.</p>
      <p>I can help you recreate a whole new interface that would be informative, intuitive, and elegant. Let me know of any specific capabilities that you're interested in including in the new F&amp;W portal so that I can give you a better cost estimate. I tried accessing the Food &amp; Wine section of the CVB site, but it was already taken down. </p>
      <p>Like you said, once the dust settles, it's time to get to work on perfecting next year's festival. Thanks again for the opportunity to convey my ideas and impressions of such an extraordinary event.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Kind regards,</p>
